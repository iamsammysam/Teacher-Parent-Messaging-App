### Capstone Concept - Samantha Collares
### Teacher Parent Communication Messaging App

Emotional and social development of young children have a direct effect on their overall development and on the adult they will become and Teachers concentrate a lot of time giving constant feedback to Parents regarding everyday points of improvement or encouraging good behavior.

I noticed (through my husband’s personal experience as an educador) that in some low income schools districts, Parents only way of communication is through regular phone calls, which take a lot of time to be made on a daily basis, taking the Teacher away from educational tasks and usually are not successful because parents are not available or due to language barriers (a significant number of Parents in low income school districts speak little or no English). Because of those two factors Parents are missing a great part of the Teacher/Parent communication about their children’s development.

The idea of creating a Teacher/Parent Communication App came to reach effectively those low income/marginalized communities and strengthen the relationship between Teacher/Parents to have a direct impact on young children’s educational, social and emotional development.
